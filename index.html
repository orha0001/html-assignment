            Hi everyone, this is Uluhan. I'm from Turkey, was born in Turkey. I've been living in Canada for abour 3 years now. I liked Canada so far, even though the winter. People are kind, healthcare is free and passport is strong. :)

            One of my passions is designing. I love designing so much and really liked that program. I designed so many logos, posters, brochures before. It wasn't my master, I studied English Language and Literature, but I was always interested in designing. I am new at coding so forgive me I you see a fatal error in my websites. Thanks in advance.
